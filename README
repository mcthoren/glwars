glwars is a student project from waaaaaay back in the days when i was wee.
if my memory serves me correctly, this was done during my time at the Prussian Academy of Automatic Machines, ca. 1844.

you get to fly a little ship and shoot lasers at one other person in a little ship on your lan!

iirc my primary reasons for making this were:
a) i needed a few more credits
b) i wanted to play with sockets and threads at the same time
c) and i mostly wanted to fly a little space ship around and shoot lasers!

i have to imagine the name glwars has been used at least a bazillion times previously to this

i thought i would revisit it and see if could update it a bit.
this was originally written for irix, on an sgi o2.
the code is slowly being improved.

keyboard commands:
arrow keys move
q:	quits 
c:	toggles chase mode view
a:	toggles autonormals
x:	increase speed by increments of a lot
space:	fires lasers!

k, d:	hacks to deal with laser hits. should prly be done somehow better.

the green bar on the left is your remaining shield strength
the blue bar on the right is your remaining pew pew!
the wee ships up top are your reaming lives

if you run:
./glwars 127.0.0.1
you can chase a ghost ship of yourself if you're tricky enough

2022-02-17: got the first stab at ipv6 in.
2016-09-29: networking brought closer to the modern..ish day
2016-09-27: compiles and runs on operating systems that actually enforce correct memory usage! whooo!
2016-09-25: compiles and runs on linux with threads and net.
2016-09-24: compiles and works, but w.o. threads/net
2016-09-23: resurrected from a long dusty tomb 
2004-05-23: got me a B in some class somewhere

todo:
better ipv6 support, use struct sockaddr storage to avoid some duplication
better visual reference than a grid of balls
rolls
flips - lookmove() should allow full 2pi for ro.
i'm not sure the ships are moving independent of the other person's frame anymore :x
