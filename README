Glwars is a student project from waaaaaay back in the days when I was wee.
If my memory is correct, this was done during my time at the Prussian Academy of Automatic Machines, ca. ~1844.

You get to fly a little ship and shoot lasers at one other person in a little ship on your lan!

Iirc my primary reasons for making this were:
a) i needed a few more credits
b) i wanted to play with sockets and threads at the same time
c) and i mostly wanted to fly a little space shit around and shoot lasers!

I have to imagine the name glwars has been used at least a bazillion times previously to this

I though i would revisit it and see if could do update it a bit. It currently reflects some pretty poor coding practices :<
