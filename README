glwars is a student project from waaaaaay back in the days when i was wee.
if my memory servers me correctly, this was done during my time at the Prussian Academy of Automatic Machines, ca. ~1844.

you get to fly a little ship and shoot lasers at one other person in a little ship on your lan!

iirc my primary reasons for making this were:
a) i needed a few more credits
b) i wanted to play with sockets and threads at the same time
c) and i mostly wanted to fly a little space ship around and shoot lasers!

i have to imagine the name glwars has been used at least a bazillion times previously to this

i though i would revisit it and see if could update it a bit.
this was originally written for irix, on an sgi o2.
it currently reflects some pretty poor coding practices :<

keyboard commands:
arrow keys move
q:	quits 
c:	toggles chase mode view
a:	toggles autonormals
space:	fires lasers!

x, d, k: various debug funcs? 

the green bar on the left is your remaining shield strength
the blue bar on the right is your remaining pew pew!
the wee ships up top are your remaing lives

if you run:
./glwars 127.0.0.1
you can chase a ghost ship of yourself if you're tricky enough

2016-09-25: compiles and runs on linux with threads and net.
2016-09-24: compiles and works, but w.o. threads/net
2016-09-23: resurrected from a long dusty tomb 
1844-05-23: got me a B in some class somewhere

todo:
workout linux memset warnings
better visual reference than a grid of balls
 also the color choosing function in glCallList() for BALLGRID is kinda wonky
make threads and net work on real os's again
like, validate data, ffs
